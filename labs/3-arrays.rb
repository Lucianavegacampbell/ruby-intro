# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# EXERCISE
# Create a "shared" shopping list with a friend
# Create two data structures - one for your list of stuff, and one
# for your friend, e.g. you want milk, eggs, and bacon, and
# your friend wants beer, cookies, and apples.
# Programmatically combine the two arrays into a single list,
# sort the result (alphabetically), and write it to the screen.
# If the two lists contain the same item, only show it once!
# Lastly, display each item in the list prepended with "buy ".


ben_list =["diapers","wipes","bath toys", "toilet paper"]
lu_list =["tacos", "pizza", "toilet paper"]

#puts ben_list.inspect

#1 combine the lists together
combined_list = ben_list + lu_list
#puts combined_list.inspect

#2. sort the lists (alphabetically)

sorted_list = combined_list.sort
puts sorted_list.inspect

#3. remove duplicates from the list
unique_list = sorted_list.uniq
puts unique_list.inspect

#4. display each item in the list prepended with "buy "

puts "buy #{unique_list[0]}"
puts "buy #{unique_list[1]}"
puts "buy #{unique_list[2]}"
puts "buy #{unique_list[3]}"
puts "buy #{unique_list[4]}"
puts "buy #{unique_list[5]}"
